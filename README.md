# Manim Project: Depth-First Search Animation

## Overview

This project is dedicated to creating animations using Manim, a powerful mathematical animation engine. The main objective is to visually illustrate the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm through an engaging and educational video. The animations are created in Python, leveraging Manim's extensive capabilities to produce high-quality visuals.
